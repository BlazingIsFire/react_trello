# Trello Clone!

I created this Trello clone using HTML, CSS, Javascript, JSX, and React. This was one of my first major projects and I am pretty pleased on how it turned out. This application was also my first time using and learning React. I feel a lot more confident now using React and creating webpages.

My next goal from here is to learn backend. I plan on creating my own webpage for myself and hosting it with a backend user authentication system!

**Thank you for checking out my project and hope you enjoy!**
